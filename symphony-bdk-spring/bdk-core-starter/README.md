# BDK2.0 Core SpringBoot Starter
The Symphony BDK2.0 SpringBoot Starter is (for now) still an experimental project. 
The development team has decided to create this module as earlier than possible in the development process in order 
to observe `Core`'s modification impacts and side effects on this module.

## Known issues
The development wants to share some known limitation detected during the development process.

### Running multiple bots within a single SpringBoot application
At the moment, the BDK SpringBoot Starter is not able to handle multiple bot instances within a single application. The
team will obviously work later on in order to fix this limitation but please note that this will potentially introduce 
strong breaking changes.
